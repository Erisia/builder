Erisia uses the [MCUpdater](http://mcupdater.com/) framework for distributing pack updates. Using this is moderately complex, compared to e.g. ATLauncher, but it also allows for quick updates.

To get started:

1. First of all, make sure you join chat. The preferred option is [Discord](https://discord.gg/VW9x7sR). This channel is linked to the servers, and is an excellent place to get help or generally hang out.
2. Make sure you have 64-bit Java 17 (or newer) installed.
3. Download and run [MCU-Bootstrap](/MCU-Bootstrap.jar).
4. Select the correct instance from the instance list, on the left.
5. Take a look at the mods list. Many of these are optional. Defaults have been provided, but use your own judgement.
6. Click update
7. After you've updated the pack and run the link script, you may want to tweak the memory allocation of the pack in PrismLauncher. Default values are provided for the pack when the script creates a linked pack entry, but if you have the RAM for it, more memory may improve performance. Or you could reduce the memory consumption if you are using a weaker computer, though going below a maximum of 4GB is likely to cause problems.
8. Click launch.

If you're lucky, this will let you into Erisia. If not, please make sure you're actually using 64-bit Java 8; if you aren't using that, you're going to need to delete the installation directory before trying again. Otherwise, ask for assistance in Discord.

Depending on your OS, here's where to find it:

- Linux: ~/.MCUpdater
- OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/MCUpdater
- Windows: %APPDATA%/.MCUpdater
