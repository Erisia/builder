IRC is the main support channel, also linked to the server chat. You can use either your own client or IRCCloud to [join the #erisia channel on irc.rizon.net,](https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23erisia&hostname=irc.rizon.net&port=6697&ssl=1) but if you're impatient, you can also use qwebirc below. Note, however, that qwebirc often fails.
