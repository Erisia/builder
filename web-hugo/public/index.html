  <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Erisia</h1>
  <p class="lead">A community Minecraft server with carefully curated modpacks</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
    <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>To our little home away from home.</p>
<p>Here, have a look at the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gKqwD">newest gallery for our server</a>. Or, if you&rsquo;re historically inclined, there are some (unorganized) <a href="screenshots">pictures</a> from <a href="https://www.brage.info/e9/">previous iterations</a> as well.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re new here, Erisia is currently running a moderately modified FTB Revelation. Look at the tab list above, and you&rsquo;ll find setup instructions as well as a live map.</p>
<p>Erisia is a long-run survival server. This means that it&rsquo;s not reset once per month — and usually not every three months, either. We aim for each iteration to last around six months, though we&rsquo;re not always successful.</p>
<p>This means that you should build with an eye to architecture. If you want to come in, &lsquo;win&rsquo; the game, and then wait for the reset — then so be it, we won&rsquo;t stop you, but the reset won&rsquo;t happen. If you enjoy building beautiful cities, however, then Erisia may be the place for you.</p>
<p>Cooperation is encouraged, though not enforced. We understand that everyone has their own playstyle, and won&rsquo;t enforce our own views save that any actions which might force a server reset will be vetoed. However, Erisia has unusually good <a href="https://grafana.brage.info/dashboard/db/minecraft?refresh=1m&amp;orgId=1">monitoring</a>, admin skill and backups, so you don&rsquo;t need to be afraid. Mistakes will not be punished, and we won&rsquo;t lose your builds.</p>
<p>The reason you should build in multiplayer, and not on your own, is because visiting other people and discussing your builds is also fun, and often so is collaboration. The reason you should do so here, and not on a different server, is for the people you can find here.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Griefing and nonconsensual PvP are both forbidden. If in doubt, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buildcraft Quarries, quarry-like autominers, etc. are all forbidden in the Overworld and Nether, due to their effect on the terrain and server lag.</p>
<p>They are explicitly <em>not</em> forbidden in the Deep Dark and Bedrock dimensions, but should be chunkloaded and removed when done. If unsure, ask.</p>
<p>Manual mining is never forbidden, but consider switching to a mining dimension (Aroma&rsquo;s, perhaps) once you can. The less swizz cheese the ground becomes, the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploits are&hellip; inadvisable. If you are found to be using one, you may find that the results go poof, destroying hours of work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least <em>try</em> to make things look nice. There&rsquo;s no requirement, but it&rsquo;d improve your reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make road-building possible and encourage community, all bases must be a <em>maximum</em> of 500m from the nearest other base or highway. To avoid FPS problems, 250m is a reasonable minimum, but if unsure ask your neighbour. If you want to build elsewhere, you can, but you&rsquo;ll need to either set up an embassy or build your own highway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimentally, in the current instance of the server, anything you would call <em>heavy automation</em>—meaning automation that is continuously running, can&rsquo;t be turned off, or which otherwise takes a heavy load on tick time while you&rsquo;re offline—must be located outside of the overworld.</p>
<p>Preferably, this means an RFTools dimension. If you don&rsquo;t want to use RFTools, you will be held to higher standards regarding efficiency and should attempt to include a shutoff switch, preferably automated. If you <em>do</em> want to use RFTools, consider arranging your power system so the machinery dimension runs out of power while you&rsquo;re logged out.</p>
<p>The upshot of this, should everything work as hoped-for, is a longer lifespan for Erisia 19 than we&rsquo;d otherwise manage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That said, have fun!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="admin-powers-limitations">Admin Powers Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Admin powers shall not be used except to fix obvious bugs or game-destroying situations.</li>
<li>If the game-destroying situation is akin to &ldquo;I got stuck in Mystcraft&rdquo; or &ldquo;I ended up forty thousand kilometers out and can&rsquo;t get back&rdquo;, without bugs being involved, then there&rsquo;s a mandatory half-hour timeout prior to action and you don&rsquo;t get to keep your inventory.</li>
<li>Unless the audience unanimously thinks otherwise.</li>
<li>These rules are subject to change via supermajority vote, with Baughn getting veto rights.</li>
</ul>
