Build scripts for the server

## Dependencies

The only dependency is Nix. You *can* acquire this by installing NixOS, but you probably won't want to. <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a> can be installed on any Linux system, following the instructions on that page.

It also works in Windows WSL, but you'll need to first follow <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1203#issuecomment-275089112">these instructions</a> to work around a current bug in WSL.

## Quick start

Make a server directory, then run update-and-start.sh using its relative path. Example:
```
$ mkdir erisia
$ cd erisia
$ git clone https://github.com/Erisia/builder.git git
$ git/update-and-start.sh
```

## Updating manifests

The .nix files used for building the modpack are generated by cursetool
from the .yaml files in `manifest/`, and should always be updated after
any change to the .yaml files.
```
$ cursetool/run.sh update manifest/e19.yaml
```

The Curse website occasionally breaks, causing mod pages to redirect to
themselves. Cursetool will use a cached value if this happens. In the event
that no cache can be found, it will backoff and retry until it can successfully
retrieve the mod page.

## General contribution workflow

Requires nix package manager and a unix environment (You can also use nixos!) of your choice to run it in.

1. Clone this repository
1. Create a directory to house the server
1. Navigate into it and run `../path/to/repository/update_and_start.sh` Choose the server you intend to build
1. Assuming all this succeeds, you can use any text editor to edit the files under manifest and base in the builder folder.  These files are the ones that influence what mods the server is running as well as the configs that get deployed to the client.

   Changing the manifest will not automatically change the running mods. See `Updating Manifests` for how to do that, and how to update mods to newer versions.

Once you've updated with cursetool and tried your changes with `update_and_start.sh` you can push your changes back up to the repo (use a branch or a fork please) and open a pull request against master.  At that point an admin can pull your changes into the server.

## Useful tips

* Dynmap quickly creates gigabytes of rendered map tiles. You might want to disable it while debugging.
* You aren't limited to running only the server. To test a new client configuration, look at the `ServerPackLocal` stance at the bottom of default.nix.
