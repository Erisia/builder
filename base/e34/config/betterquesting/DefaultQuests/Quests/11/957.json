Alas, it was not enough to protect them, but it is still quite the feat of warfare! The wood of the bow appears to be from a specialized form of tree grown by a nature mage that grows into the bow\u0027s shape and has the natural magic property of seeking foes. The string of the bow is full of Ender magic and imbues the arrows launched from it with a powerful, withering effect. The arrows meant for it have a crystal cluster tip and a carmite core that heals you from a distance, and the fletching seems to be a unique creeper spore-based propusion system that launces it like a rocket! Neat.",
