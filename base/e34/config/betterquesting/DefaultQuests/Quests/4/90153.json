Each pattern encodes a recipe or processing step.\n\nIf the interface is touching a molecular assembler, it will perform a crafting recipe.\n\nIf the interface is next to a machine (furnace, pulverizer, chest, etc) it will perform a processing recipe.\n\nSome machines don\u0027t auto output, so you will have to use conduits or other transfer pipes to put machine outputs back into the interface.",
