      "desc:8": "§7§oThe quantum bridge is a multiblock that allows you to do two things: \n\nTransfer 32 channels wirelessly over infinite distances and between dimensions.\nObtain a pair of entangled singularties and a pair of quantum bridges that you would like to connect. Place an entangled singularity in each quantum bridge to link them.\nBoth sides of the connection should have a power input, either from the Controller or from an Energy Acceptor, and both should have at least one Energy Cell.\nYou can use these to run p2p subnets, but they may misbehave depending on the complexity of your subnet.\n\nInfinitely expand the range of your wireless terminals.\nConnect a quantum bridge to the network which you would like to access wirelessly. Insert the quantum link card into the quantum bridge. Note that this will prevent you from inserting an entangled singularity because a quantum bridge can only have one function at a time. This also replaces the need for a wireless access point.\n\nThanks to Fox for the Help!",
