The side opposite to it is the reset, and the two sides with the square lamps are the inputs.\n\nIf one of the inputs receives a signal, the corresponding light will turn on.\n\nThe output will produce a pulse after both lights are turned on.\n\nIf a redstone signal is applied to the reset side, it will turn off both lights.",
