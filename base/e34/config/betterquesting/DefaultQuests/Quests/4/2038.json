      "desc:8": "§7§oFlux Networks are used to transfer energy wirelessly, and are the preferred energy transfer method in the pack.\n\nTo create your own Flux Network, you need a Controller. You can specify the name of teh network and a color in the Controller GUI. Each Flux Networks machine will have to be bound to a network to function.\n\nFlux Plugs are used to move energy from a source to a network.\n\nFlux Points are used to move energy from a network to a set of machines.\n\nFlux Storage is used to include a buffer of energy in a network. If you have to transfer large amounts of RF/t, Storage is required to prevent energy cutouts.\n\nIt is recommended to still use other energy transfer methods to limit the use of Flux Plugs, as using too many can cause lag. If you want to power a machine wall, for example, use a single Flux Point, and Energy Conduits of the appropriate size to power the machines.\n\nYour base should have two Flux Networks, one to move energy from your generators to a centralized energy storage (eventually the Draconic Energy Orb), one to move energy from storage to all of your machines.",
