For more info about the inside see attached quests.\n\nGiven a controller and casings around a cuboid, these reactors can be used for a variety of radioactive fuels.\nDepending on the fuels used, there are different heat requirements the reactor will need to fulfill to avoid meltdowns.\nThe website https://leu-235.com/ is the recommended way of building these reactors.\nDesign by Uchiwars also works well for power gen!\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/vzBd16k",
