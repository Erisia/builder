      "desc:8": "§7§oCelestial crystals can be duplicated using liquid starlight.\n\nIf a celestial crystal is at max size (900) it has a chance of being split in two different crystals when dropped in liquid starlight. This will consume the bucket of starlight.\n\nThis process can be automated by using an auto-placer to keep a block space full of starlight, and by using an entity detector from cyclic to send a redstone signal to a collector when two entities (aka two crystals) are present in the designated block space.\n\nThe system can be set up to pick up only one of the two crystals, or to pick up both, and drop one of them back into the starlight.\n\n",
