It can collect from both nearby jars, and from an essentia infusion provider.\n\nTo select a recipe, place the desired input item, and click on the desired output to bind the thaumatorium to that recipe. If the input item is present, essentia will be automatically drained and the recipe output will be dropped in world in fron of the crucible. A hungry chest or a vacuum chest can be used to collect outputs.\n\n",
