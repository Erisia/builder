      "desc:8": "§7§oEssentia is a magical fluid that can be created, moved, and consumed as part of many thaumcraft mechanics. While the crucible can be used to create essentia, it can only be used within those constraints.\n\nTo create essentia, you need an essentia smeltery, which works like a furnace that \u0027smelts\u0027 items into their essentia component (which can be seen in JEI).\nPlace arcane alembics on top of the smeltery to collect the output. If no alembics are present, flux will be made.\nThe higher the tier, the better the yield out of each item, and the least flux will be made each operation. Mithrillium tier and above make no flux.\n\nEssentia can be stored using phials, or using jars. Phials are like buckets, which can be used to move essentia between containers. Jars are like tanks, which can be placed in world. Labels can be used to filter jars to store only one type of essentia.\n\nTo transport essentia, there are pipes, but you should not use those. Instead, the filling and emptying essentia transfusers can be used to move essentia wirelessly.\nThe filling essentia transfuser is used as a machine output, and it automatically pushes essentia into jars.\nThe emptying essentia transfuser is used as a machine input, and it automatically pulls essentia out of jars.\n",
