Right click the structure with a vanilla carpet to form the altar!\n\nThe altar generates energy passively. Right clicking the altar with an empty hand will tell you the available energy, as well as the maximum energy for the altar. Most mechanics in bewitchment use ME to run!\n\nThe amount of diverse nature (crops, trees, flowers) will set the maximum ME. The more different plants you have, the higher the maximum energy in the altar!\n\nYou can place statues around the altar, or particular artifacts on the altar to add multipliers to ME rate and amount. These will show up when searching \u0027witches altar\u0027 in JEI.",
