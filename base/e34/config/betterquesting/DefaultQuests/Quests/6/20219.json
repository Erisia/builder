You can also use causality collapsers but they are not as reliable.\n\nTo make a flux rift, you need high levels of flux in a chunk. The best way of doing this is to go far far away from your base, and to drop a lot of compressed cobblestone into a crucible.\n\nPlace the siphon near the rift, and it will slowly suck it and drop void seeds nearby. You can collect those with a vacuum chest of some sort.\n\nIf you want to use the collapser, just click it on a rift, and it will explode with a chance of dropping void seeds.\n\nAfter making an initial batch, the void seedling can be used to safely automate void seeds.",
