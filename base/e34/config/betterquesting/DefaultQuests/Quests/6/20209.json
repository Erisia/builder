This can only be done with ProjectE tables, not the ProjectEX ones!\n\n§fThis table is quite full of alchemical powers!\nMany of the objects and materials existing in this universe have a certain amount of alchemical energy embedded in their nature.\nBy exploiting the nature of this energy, the transmutation table allows to convert and transform things, by the law of equivalent exchange.\nThe table can learn objects, and by using this \u0027energy-matter currency\u0027 (EMC) I can have a steady and near-endless supply of many useful things.\nGranted, I would need to set up some way to farm objects with high EMC.",
