Abyssalcraft also interacts with Warp from Thaumcraft, producing it at most interactions with the enemies and dimensions you will encounter in this progression (see more info in the Thaumcraft quests or in the Warp Basics JEI info box).\n\nThe mod does not have many automation tools, but custom multiblocks become available relatively early on to allow for automation.",
