Different colors count as different blocks!\n\nIn addition, Stabilizers from Thaumcraft can be used to prevent some bad effects. Redstone Inlays should be used to connect the stabilizers to each pedestal. These should still follow central symmetry.\n\nThe following stabilizing blocks are listed in order of stability power (you should have at most 6 of each):\nCandelabra,\nCandles,\nMob heads",
