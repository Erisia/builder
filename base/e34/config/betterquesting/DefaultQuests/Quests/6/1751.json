Eating brains\n2. Unlocking thaumcraft research\n3. Fighting mobs from abyssalcraft\n4. Exploring abyssalcraft dimensions\n\nWarp is checked using a sanity checker!\n\nIf your warp level is high, you will gain debuffs, and special mobs will start spawning around you.\n\nThere are three types of warp, temporary, sticky, and permanent.\nTemporary warp goes down over time, and is bright pink in the sanity checker.\nSticky warp needs sanityzing soap or warp cleansers to be removed, and is purple in the sanity checker.\nPermanent warp is only removed using the dreadlands and omothol warp cleansers, and is dark purple in the sanity checker.\n",
