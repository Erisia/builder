      "desc:8": "§7§oWoot lets you build mob farms without spawning mobs. Note, they can get large!\n\nThere are 4 tiers of woot farms! Each tier will drop shards of the tier after (tier 1 farm drops tier 1 and 2 shards)!\n\nTo start, craft a factory heart and an intern! The intern lets you select a tier, and it will tell you the materials you need to build the woot farm! Clicking the heart with the intern will build the mobfarm!\n\nAfter the structure is complete, you will have to add some blocks manually. To check is those are correct, right click the factory heart with a ya hammer.\n\nPlace the following blocks under the farm, in this exact order from top to bottom, directly under the heart, with a gap of at most 10 blocks: power cell, factory importer, factory exporter.\n\nTo farm a specific mob with woot, you need a bound ender shard. Hit a mob with it, and kill it after to bind your shard (it will start glowing).\n\nUse the bound shard to craft a controller, and place it on top of the block behind the factory heart!\n\n§fCreating creatures and monsters is cool and all, but making them digitally is better (for chunks and fps).\nAlso, it seems like these factories can produce things that normally seem to only come from my sword!",
