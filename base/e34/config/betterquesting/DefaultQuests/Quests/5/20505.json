Make sure you set it to ExtC mode to keep the dragon heart!\nThe diamonds can be piped into a condenser MK2 to make more blaze rods than you started with!\nPipe the blaze rods from the condenser back into the crafter, to complete the loop!\nYou can dump the excess blaze rods into another condenser to farm any EMC item you want!\n\n\n§fWhile basic Condensers are very good when connected to Relays or Collectors, if items are fed into this baseline version, things get a bit awkward...\nThe upgraded Condenser is designed for item duplication from outside inputs (E.G. cobble gen, crop farms).\nThere are some very good farms that passively produce items with high EMC values",
