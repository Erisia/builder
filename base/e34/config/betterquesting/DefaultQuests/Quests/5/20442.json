      "desc:8": "§7§oTo farm mob drops with Deep Mob Learning (Evolution), you need a simulation chamber, a loot fabricator, and a steady supply of polymer clay (which has EMC), as well as a data model.\n\nTo function, a simulation chamber needs a data model that has been configured to a mob.\n\nTo configure a model, you need to place one for the mob you want to farm into the deep learner. Then you want to slay a certain number that mob to activate the model, while holding the learner into your hotbar.\n\nThe more mobs you slay, the higher the tier of the model. The higher the tier, the better.\n\nPlacing a model in the simulation chamber will produce pristine matter, which is consumed in loot fabricators to farm specific mob drops.\n\n§fA simulation chamber that has been programmed with a data model consumes polymer clay to produce mob matter.\nThe loot fabricator uses pristine matter to produce mob drops.",
