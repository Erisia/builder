All stats have a level ranging from 1 to 10.\n\nAll planted crops start at level 1/1/1, and become much better when levelled to 10/10/10. \n\nIf you right click crop sticks with crop sticks, you make crossing crop sticks.\n\nIf crossing crop sticks are placed next to planted crop sticks, the plant will spread, sharing its stats.\n\nIf two or more planted crops are placed around double crop sticks, the resulting plant may come out with better stats.\n\nThe seed analyzer can be used to look at a given plant\u0027s stats. \n\nIf you want to challenge yourself with some boolean logic, integrated dynamics can be used to automate the process of making 10/10/10 seeds.",
