Some are good, and some are, well, not great.\n\nThe genetic sampler is the first step in making your bees better! It takes bees, and has a chance of producing gene samples from a given bee.\n\nFor each bee species that has a desirable gene (the best ones are listed in the following quests), you can dump excess drones into the sampler, until you obtain the gene samples you desire!\n\nSee next quests for more info on how to transfer good genes to other bees!\n\n§fBy consuming drones, which can be endlessly bred, I can isolate specific gene traits. Some of them (but just some) are very useful!",
