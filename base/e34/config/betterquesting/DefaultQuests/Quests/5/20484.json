Use the industrial apiary instead!\n\nThe apiary will produce bee offspring following mendelian genetics. Given a dominant gene A, and a recessive gene a, if the queen is AA and the drone is aa, the offspring will have a 25% chance of being AA (expressing A), 50% chance of being Aa (expressing A), 25% chance of being aa (expressing a).\n\n§fAn apiary is used to get honey combs from bees (no really?!), but it\u0027s not a really good way of doing it.",
