Glowstone are the better source for these purposes. The more glowstone blocks surrounding a collector, the faster EMC will be produced.\nSecondly, Relays act like like EMC batteries, and are able to transmit this type of power to/from adjacent blocks. This means that the energy from multiple collectors can be funnled into a single block using a Relay.\nFinally, condensers can use EMC provided by adjacent relays and collectors to duplicate a given item.\nA condenser, to remain accessible with maximum efficiency, still has five free faces, and so do relays...",
