The nether roof is a good place to go look!\n\n§fNot sure on what the origin for such an occurrence could be, but in the past a great amount of thaumic energy has been unleashed, opening permanent rifts connecting Terra with a strange realm dominated by taint.\nLikely, this realm had been created (or taken over) by a might thaumaturgist trying to dominate taint. Needless to say, they failed, and now this land is purely dominated by corruption.",
