Considering the amount of incredible powers this people has encountered, it is interesting to see how they dealt with the threats of mass destruction. No testificate equivalent of nukes, despite having more than enough means to create even more destructive things.\nWhatever the main cultural values of testificate civilization may be, something instilled the idea that power corrupts, and it is evident while listening to any testificate narrate their history. Even more remarkable, is the lack of any apparent government in testificate society.\nI still think that something is being hidden from me, probably some story where the testificates indeed sought power, but I do appreciate their commitment to only use power when absolutely necessary.\nOne of these sources of power, apparently left there for emergencies, was hidden in the nether caves, and should come in handy for some more powerful blood magic.\nWhat confuses me is why not use these powers against the invaders of Terra?
