These ones are capable of actual magic, to an extent, and can produce shields against some types of attacks.\nApparently the testificates decided they did not want to deal with said dragons, and they let them be. \nWell, I did not; their magic is very peculiar, and I will try to do as much as possible to investigate it.\nEver since I came here, I am finding myself obsessing more over things like this. I am a curious person, I have always been, but this may be a bit too much. There is so much new stuff to learn though, and I really need some answers.",
