      "desc:8": "The nature of all these new materials makes it so their properties can be mixed and matched in a fairly easy fashion.\nThe upfront cost is a bit steep, but I was able to combine some of them into a useful metallic alloy base tho serve a variety of purposes.\nIt can act as a metal by itself, but thanks to its ductility, it also serves as a matrix for composites materials.\nWhat is interesting about this metal alloy, in addition to what I have said before, is that, if I am right about my theories on mythic magic, it could be reproduced using other recursive matter as well.\nI have yet to come up with an accurate means of production, but this feels like a type of discovery akin to shape-memory alloys. After the study of gold-cadmium alloys, the same was observed (with better results) in nickel-titanium alloys.\nI strongly suspect there are going to better ways of making this Ultimate alloy.",
