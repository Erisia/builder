      "desc:8": "I was about to say, in a universe so full of weird magic, mighty powers, and great wars, I really haven\u0027t seen that many guns.\nAnd, of course, the first society of gun lovers I meet are the Bees of Falacer! I gotta say, I think I\u0027ll still take a magic wand over a gatling gun, but it\u0027s good to know that there are people (err, bees) that appreciate a good firearm.\nWell, appreciation is an understatement, they turned a whole planet into a gun market, and they really seem to be loving it. \nBees are amazing, I gotta say! They seem to be running this solar system, and yet they still manage to be friendly, and just straight up nice. I wonder what their relationship with the invaders of Terra may be. The bees I have met have been very friendly, but not necessarily prodigal of information. It would be good to know where they stand in this conflict.",
