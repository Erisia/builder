      "desc:8": "The quest for knowledge is not an easy one. As a practitioner of science, I have had many confirmations of this. Answers lead to more questions, which lead to more answers, which lead to more questions.\nThis answer, though, I am happy with! The bees are helping the Testificates! And I am all about helping the testificates!\nAs I was told in Furatto, there are still few, faithful to the Arbiter, that are pushing a campaign against the invaders of Terra. The rest of testificate society deemed them crazy, and thought them dead.\nApparently, they are still fighting, and their main ally are the bees! The massive facilities to forge armor and imbue potions on Osiris and Ptah serve the war effort in the buffer worlds of the Shyre empire.\nAfter seeing how nice bees are, I\u0027m not surprised they want to help, but if it were that simple, why keep it a secret? Why not say it openly like the bee societies of Hator and Orcus?",
