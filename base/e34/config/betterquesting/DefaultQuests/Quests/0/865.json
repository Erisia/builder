This place, the world of Vibe, was in the process of being taken over in a similar way to the Abyss, by a soul of corruption that had turned most of its surface into a land of corruption and blight.\nAnd how did these five alone deal with this? By using a blight of their own. This world is now free of the corruption of the Shyre Empire because it has been taken over by adifferent corruption, taint. A whole lot of taint.\nWhile this put a stop to the enemy, it did not quite defeat it for good. This powerful soul of corruption is still living, permeating the whole of the planet. But, thanks to some newly available thaumic artifacts, it can be hurt, and even kileld, it just takes a very long time doing it.",
