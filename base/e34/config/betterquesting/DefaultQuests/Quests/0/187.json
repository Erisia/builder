      "desc:8": "The terra system is truly a wonderful world!\nThanks to the incredible powers provided by the resources here, civilizations evolved with incredible abilities!\nHator is the home planet of the Realmshifters, beings able to bend and warp all dimensions of space as if it was nothing...\nWhen the Shyre Empire and Twilight Horde came, the Realmshifters used their powers to infiltrate their worlds. Unfortunately, their knowledge and affinity to alchemy was not enough, and they could achieve very little on the military front...\nSo they came to the bees for help, who shared some of their knowledge on genetic manipulation.\nBut nothing comes for free. Some brave realmshifters decided to forsake their intelligence at the cost of strength, and were turned into large cyclopses. Using their space-bending abilities, they now wander the universe fighting invaders, but their mindlessness causes them to act erratically.\n",
