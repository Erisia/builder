The idea of a single head, a single emperor, while tantalizing and appropriately climactic, does not make much strategic sense, especially given the powers of the players involved in this game...\nA hydra with many heads located in different places, on the other hand, makes a lot of sense.\nIf the other appellatives speak to more executive branches, or whatever these beings do with their Kardashev-scale government, the Primordial Fractallites are figures of law. The brains behind this whole operation.",
