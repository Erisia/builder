Right click the structure with the engineer\u0027s hammer to form it!\n\nCoke is the best fuel, but charcoal can also be used!\n\n§fNice! The architecture on Terra has a lot of useful features. I should be able to use these materials to make a blast furnace, and study the properties of the metals found in this planet.",
