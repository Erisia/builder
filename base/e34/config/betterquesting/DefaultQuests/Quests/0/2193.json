      "desc:8": "Something should be noted about the God of the Realmshifters. A figure of Trinity that even the bees revere, starkly resembling the Christian God on Earth. This God seems to be at the base of the culture of selflessness that guides Realmshifter civilization.\nThey claim their alchemical powers, which allowed them to create fiery pyrite, come from this Trinity.\nI myself have asked myself where my affinity to magic comes from, especially with respect to alchemy, which I have seen nobody else perform outside of the Realmshifters.\nTestificates can be trained in all magical arts, but to them, alchemy, the principles of equivant exchange, are nothing but unreachable mysteries. To me it comes easy, to them, it is impossible. It is undeniable that it requires some sort of \u0027gift\u0027, but where does this gift come from?\nWhen I asked the Realmshifters about this, I did not get an answer. But they all smiled, and laughed with joy.",
