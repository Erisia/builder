And I guess it is possible to have two planets with the same planetary genesis. \nEuropa in the solar system is an earth-sized moon of a gas giant, Jupiter, that has formed into a fully-frozed land containing large amounts of water in its soil and atmosphere.\nEuropa in the sol systems  is an earth-sized moon of a gas giant, Jupiter, that has formed into a fully-frozed land containing large amounts of water in its soil and atmosphere. Makes sense, I guess.\nEuropa\u0027s dense water atmosphere makes this world mostly uninhabited, with the exception of bees. Bees are everywhere, and they really don\u0027t care about how inhospitable this planet is.\nThe bee population here is quite widespread, but they seem to be much more reserved than the ones I have encountered elsewhere. They seem to be hiding something. ",
