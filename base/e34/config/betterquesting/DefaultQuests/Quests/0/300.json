      "desc:8": "The stakes are high, my whole being is on the line in this place.\nMy recursion is bound, even my death takes me back to this place, this realm, the nightmare world of Vethea.\nThe most basic layer of reality, and yet the most inaccessible.\nThe creatures that inhabit this place are dangerous. Well, at least in my actual state. If only I had access to the technology I had out there. But no, this is a challenge I must face as myself, as my true self.\nThose that inhabit this place, they are like me. Better, they used to be like me. Seeking power and greatness, for reasons some of them likely thought to be rigtheous, they were confronted with the true nakedness of their being, and they were destroyed by it. They now wander the eternal nightmare as its prisoners, powerful recursive beings capable of great things out there, turned into mindless beasts, destroyed by their inability to confront themselves, trapped here forever.\nAnd yet, I am given a way out. Why was there a portal waiting for me? Why can I leave and come back?",
