      "desc:8": "Ever since its inception, the bigegst challenge to string theory was figuring out a way to prove that it is true.\nFor many years, the primary method to verify its veridicity was showing the existence of magnetic monopoles, magnets with only a north, or only a south. \nThis, though, turned out to be a very hard task, and my research was able to prove string theory using a different approach, the theory of wormholes, which is why I am here in the first place.\nNow that I know the theory is true, I also indirecly know that monopoles are indeed possible. And I just made some!\nAll I needed was some Sednanite!",
