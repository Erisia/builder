What made them willing to forsake all their struggles so far, and even consider giving up to the Twilight Horde?\nFacing the Experienced Cori without truly understanding Fractallites may have been a mistake. I do not even know what its power is!\nWell, I now have an inkling of what it may be. The same twisting of the recursive field that was around the Experienced Cori can be now felt all over Terra. A twisting I suspect may have to do with willpower...\nMe facing it, I suspect, may have pushed it over the edge, and unleashed it against Terra as a whole.\nIs this being twisting the will of the Testificates? Well, I must get to the bottom of it!",
