      "desc:8": "The actions I take, the subject of the prophecies I am now quite certain to be part of, are quite surely freely taken.\nThere is nothing special about me, I could have given up, but I did not want to.\nThat, I think, is where the answer lies. Being able of doing something does not imply that I necessarily want to do it. The circumstances of life are messy and chaotic, and we are both shaped by them while having our own preexisting morals and ideals.\nIs this what the prophecies were about? Desires as opposed to actions?\nNo, it cannot be this simple. Much of my own adventure (if we can call it an adventure) revolves around the plan the Meatball Man had for me. And that took the form of actions, lots of actions, which may have ended up with me remaining imprisoned in his grasp.\nSo I am free, but my actions were foretold. I am helped, but have to help myself.",
