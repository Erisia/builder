There is something more to it.\nResearching what remains of Asgard, now the Dungeon of Arcana, did bear fruit. \nIt seems like the aesir had devised ways to channel recursion, coming from matter with mythic properties, into a sort of transmutation.\nFrom my independent studies, I was able to achieve similar results using mythic miners. Their methods, though, appear to be more effective. Agents of the Shyre Empire seem to agree with me, otherwise why would these secrets be held in the Abyss.\nWhat is interesting to me about this is the fact that the Shyre Empire is holding secrets from a territory under the Twilight Horde. I can only assume there may be some espionage or intelligence war going on. Is this how they compete with each other when they are not able to figuratively and literally nuke each other?",
