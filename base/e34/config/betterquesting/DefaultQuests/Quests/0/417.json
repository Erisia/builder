      "desc:8": "Well, turns out the trap in Mysterium did reveal some of the secrets I held.\nThe Shyre Empire found out about the laser chickens! \nNot only did they start making an army of them, they powered them up using chaos. I guess I should not be surprised that my enemies have aces in their sleeves too. Aces that may annhilate the entire galaxy if unleashed.\nThis is really scary. As of now, I am likely the largest threat my enemies may have encountered in a very long time. What if they were to decide that getting rid of me is more important than safeguarding their precious Dimensional Shards.\nKnowing what they do would really be helpful for enstablishing a proper course of action, but alas, I must not go gentle now. Not when the rulers of my enemies are at hand.",
