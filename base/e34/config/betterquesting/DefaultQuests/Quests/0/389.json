And this drives me crazy.\nAnd yet, I am strangely finding a purpose in this condition. I am absolutely unsure if my struggle in Vethea will help Terra, but I can try to make it so.\nI have agency, and I can do all that I can to do good through my actions. Does this guarantee that my choices will be good? No, but I am still free to strive towards good, and that may just be enough.",
