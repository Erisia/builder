      "desc:8": "The alliance of bees with Blood God of Orcus is a strange one. Once a Testificate, this being got corrupted by powerful blood magic, and their form was morphed, as it often happens.\nWhat came out, though, was unexpected. A firendly form, some may even say adorable. This master of blood is not an enemy, rather, an unfortunate victim of fate (aren\u0027t we all). As long as the Blood God receives sacrifices, their destructive powers are kept in check, and they maintain a clear and level head, even capable of friendly conversation. Because of this, the bees decided to help out, and formed an entire civilization devoted to performing sacrifices, so that this being could maintain their humanity.\nI spoke with the Blood God, I was challeged by them. They wanted to know if I was worthy. Very happy I was, now they are willing to help me.",
