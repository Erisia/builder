As a wandering kid, trying to imagine what alien civilizations may look like, I always thought technology would be the way. But I now have evidence that magic, of the \u0027mythic\u0027 type, can be enough to support a galactic rule.\nWell, to be fair, this magic may just be technology I do not understand yet.\nAnyhow, I keep having direct interactions with it, so there may be a way to directly use this powers to actively fight back.\nIf mythic magic is enough to conquer galaxies, it should be enough to protect Terra, right?",
