It would make sense that the effects of the powder resonated with the magic powers of those affected by it, so different magical attitudes led to different transformations. Some colder than others.\nThis does raise a question, though, I have seen other mythological creatures on Terra too. My senses tell me they are not from the Twilight Forest, but it would be safe to assume that the same powder, the same virus, may have been used in other places and other times.\nWho knows what many of the enemies I have encountered so far looked like in the past?",
