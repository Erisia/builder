Powerful Wyverns.\nThanks to them, I have finally gained more info about the strange magic I witnessed in Crystevia. The Wyverns on Apichisi wield it too, and use it to gain incredible speed.\nTo harness this magic, crystals play an important role in storing it, but I still have no idea how it is generated. The constructs of Crystevia hold it in the mineral that is embedded in their bodies, the wyverns hold it in a strange organ located in theit thorax, a gemheart of inorganic crystalline matter.",
