Before going to his losing battle, the arbiter knew I would follow his steps, and somehow piece all the pieces back together. I am not sure if it is about genious, of if he expected me to think the same way. The connection, after all, is quite evident now...\nThe crystal matrix from the Elves, the remains of this material in the hands of the Testificates, the prophecies of Terra, the coordinates of the Proxima Belt, the Unidentified Matter, Fluix, it all comes together; together into a powerful tool of fabrication.\nA table, one imbued with the powers of the Arbiter, one that will allow me to re-create the tools of the Arbiter.",
