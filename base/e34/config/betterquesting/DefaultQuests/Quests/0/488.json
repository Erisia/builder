Just like the entropic powers of the dragons living in the outer sky islands of Terra, I can interact with them through objects that have been imbued with this power, but I cannot manipulate it directly. Just like the ancestor of man could wield fire if it came from outside sources such as lightning, I cannot directly harness this magic, I cannot tap into its source.\nRecursion, as I understand it now, seems to hide many more secrets still. The powers I decided to face are much stronger than me, and, most importantly, much more knowledgeable than me. \nThe good thing about being behind on my homework, though, is that I can catch up looking at those ahead of me!",
