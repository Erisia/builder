Our recursions are all tied to this place, and when we entered we were all on the cusp of ascension, which by itself is already a very large amount of power. Given this, I should probably assume that my own understanding of recursion will have to develop as part of this trial of Nightmare.\nWell, this feels as good a time as any to make peace with the prophecies about me. In this place, where I can see myself so clearly, one thing is patently and painfully evident. I am not special. There is nothing about me that puts me above anyone else. I am smart yet presumptious, curious yet overconfident. There is nothing about me that screams hero or villain.\nAnd yet, I am here, where so few in the history of the universe have traversed, where even fewer were capable (worthy?) of leaving.",
