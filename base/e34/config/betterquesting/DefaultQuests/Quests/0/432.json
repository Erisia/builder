That is what being an Old One means, I fear. Knowedge comes with a price, this much I know; I am likely the most accomplished human researcher ever, and yet I have nobody to share this knowledge with, and the main applications I have for what I do are carrying on this crazy suicide mission. \nYes, knowledge can twist a person in often terrible ways, and certain knowedge, like the one I have before me, has a price higher than other.\nThis does not stop me from banging incomprehensible ancient tomes against random objects until things happen, though.",
