Thanks to them, I now know that the right thing is to divulge the secrets of Lunalus, to make others aware of what the Shyre Empire was hiding.\nAfter having seen all of this, it truly is remarkable that the Arbiter, the paradigm of Order, decided to share everything they knew with the Testificates.
