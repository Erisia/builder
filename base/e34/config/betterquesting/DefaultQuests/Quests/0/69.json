Using them is highly recommended.\n\n§fThe manufacturing ability I\u0027ve recently discovered has allowed me to produce Fluix, which makes it possible to easily transition between matter and energy, this should be very useful for storage and item management.\nThe knowledge of this science is hidden in asteroids, which were once part of the belt around Terra.\nIt seems like they were used to hide information about fluix in a place unreachable by most, no matter how powerful.\nFortunately for me, some of those asteroids made it back down.",
