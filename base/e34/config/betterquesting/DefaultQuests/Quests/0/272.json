Thankfully, the Bubbell Alliance was there first!\nThe outer world of this binary star system, the shield onto which potential invaders will have to crash, is thankfully inhabited by allies.\nThe Bees of Rhenia are different than the ones in the Sol system. These ones are willing and ready to fight, and have replaced their natural naivety with cold, data-driven, strategic thinking.",
