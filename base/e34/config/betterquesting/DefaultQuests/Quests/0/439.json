      "desc:8": "While the dragons were definitely hostile, they appeared to have grown increasingly fond of me. Not unlike the bees, I suspect, they may have tested me and my worthiness.\nI guess I could see why dragons were the dogs of Lyndenwyrm, they have an incredible sense of faithfullness, and a deep sense of belonging.\nA belonging I now feel too, a belonging to a history that is so much bigger than I once expected. The dragons were once the wardens of the Testificates, a role I am now, to some extent, undertaking too.\nI feel some sort of kinship, and so do the dragons. Enough of a kinship to allow me access to the dangerous weapons once developed by the people of the Arbiter.",
