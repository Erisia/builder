Each quest in this chain will have an optional objective to make the appropriate callstone to craft.\n\n§fThis is freaky... I don\u0027t like it at all...\nAs I started reading the pages of the necronomicon, I became aware of something...\nMy destiny may be predetermined, and someone is responsible for it.\n(No not Sainagh the pack author)\nThere is an order of druids that worships those that have written the book of the dead, and they, for some reason, have chosen me for a task I cannot avoid...\nNow that I have read the pages I know this, and I know where they come from.
