It truly felt like it was a game for him.\n\"Yes, you are becoming powerful. unascended one\"\n\"The boredom of the undead lands is finaly over, my fight can resume\"\n\"Order is indeed coming back, as it always does, and so will our struggle, my dear friend\"\nYes, he definitely thinks of me as some chosen one, but chosen to do what? Fight him because he was bored? What type of order am I supposed to restore?\nWell, the only thing I can think of, is balancing the forces between Terra and its invaders, it is not like I could be doing any of this if I did not receive my powers from the Meatball Man himself, though.",
