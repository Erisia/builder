The prophecy?\nWhat is the prophecy about, though?\nI am tied to Terra, I was capable of resurrecting the technology of the Arbiter, and its nemesis, the Meatball Man is somehow antagonizing me.\nI fought for Terra. I encountered some of the greatest beings in the universe, and my inability to face them is what brought me here.\nNow that I am here, though, the Twilight Horde and the Shyre Empire start to seem less and less important.\nMy mission, I am starting to see, is not simply to defend the Testificates and the Dimensional Shards. My mission is not simply composed by my own actions.\nMy mission is who I am. Is this true for everyone? No! That is why so few make it out of here! That is why so many decide to give up! \nThat is why so many do not get help in Vethea, while I did! It is not because they were forsaken by the Mysterious people. A hand was offered, but with it came the realization that, to make it out of here, one would have to take on a mission, to become a mission.\nThat is what being a Fractallite is! Mission! And this is the sacrifice I must undergo! I have to use my own freedom to become mission, to act according to something bigger than myself! ",
