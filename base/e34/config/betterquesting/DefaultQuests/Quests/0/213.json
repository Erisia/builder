Follow the scanner. §o§7§oBreak blocks after finishing dungeon.\n\n§fEncountering other astral magic users has revealed some interesting things. The magic I am able to unleash is not so different from electromagnetism. Just like the magnetized needle on a compass is capable of sensing this field, for some reason I can sense the \u0027field of magic\u0027. \nWhen I started this journey, I was just a magnetized needle, but my own field is getting stronger, I can sense it.\nI should be careful, though, the cube I encountered in the sky islands was full of astral powers, so much that it eventually rebelled against its creators. I see why the testificate astral mages were banished to the sky islands, life, even when created artificially, should not be controlled.",
