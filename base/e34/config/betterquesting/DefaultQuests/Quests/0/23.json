It has specific rules, but these rules directly relate to emerging concepts. When I mine, I get stuff that weren\u0027t there, but what does \u0027mine\u0027 mean? Does this only work on some types of stone, but not others? What if I am using the wrong tool?\nAnd how does the magic force guiding this even know that I am \u0027mining\u0027 as opposed to \u0027logging\u0027?\n",
