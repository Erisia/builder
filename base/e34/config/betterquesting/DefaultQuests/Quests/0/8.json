This is scary!\nI thought I would be done for, I thought I was going to die...\nInstead, everything turned dark, and a strange feeling came over me, and I suddenly woke up!\nAfter killing some of the undead-looking creatures that roam this planet at night, I got my hands on this strange powder.\nTouching it gave me a feeling similar to what I felt whenever I thought I would die.\nIt seems like I cannot die. Instead, I lose my ability to carry things, and I somehow manage to travel in some sort of \u0027ghostly shape\u0027 for a few hours after that.\nShould I assume that someone, or something, wants me alive?!",
