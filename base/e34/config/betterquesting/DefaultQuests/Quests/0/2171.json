      "desc:8": "The Fluix Historians are an old organization in Terra lore.\nTheir existence as a group of scholars started as the Arbiter came, bringing a new material that started raining on the planet inside meteorites, Fluix.\nThe group of erutites would collect the knowledge and crafts provided by the Arbiter, and regulated the use of these powers to ensure order.\nOnce war came, the order led the Testificates to retaliate, and this effort led to the campaign through the Warper Planes.\nThey are now a smaller, less powerful organization, dwindled to just a few faithfuls, and yet they still carry on their mission to mantain the history of the Arbiter alive.\nWhen I asked the historian what had happened to their guide, I got no answers...\nThe testificate seems to like me though, and he asked some questions about how I ended up in Terra. Very, very specific questions, now that I think of it...\nWhy would it be important that my wormhole opened next to a sky stone asteroid?\nAnyhow, I got my hands on some Arbiter tech, and it\u0027s quite awesome!",
