      "desc:8": "Molten salt fission reactors! Scientists back on Earth spent quite a long time figuring out how to squeeze as much thermal power out of nuclear fission as possible, and this is what they came up with!\nWhile it was quite a big leap back then, this technology hardly compares to my current energy production capabilities, and yet it may have its usefulness. \nMost matter, even the one that makes up a simple banana, has a low but non-negligible level of radiation, and while this radiation is too small for making electricity, it can be used for material breeding.\nI really want to put recursive matter into a molten salt reactor! I really really want to do it!",
