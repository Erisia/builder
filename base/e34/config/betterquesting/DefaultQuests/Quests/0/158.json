For most it\u0027s a small amount, much less than me.\nRecursion seems to be directly tied to the soul, and thanks to the magic knowledge I now have, I can start using it.\nIt\u0027s nothing big, but I don\u0027t need essence to create living matter anymore!\nThis means of organic replication is much more involved than using the \u0027standard\u0027 essence method developed back on earth (which is what I\u0027ve been using until now).\nThat said, on its upper end, it is much more effective!",
