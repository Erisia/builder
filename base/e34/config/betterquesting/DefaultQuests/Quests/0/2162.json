Fluctuatite itself holds some of it, and the flying beast Graw was close to ascending.\nThis creature had learned the secret behind Warren magic, the origin of the Mythic Shells, and the most evident example of Fractallite magic I have encountered so far.\nIf the structure of Skythern is a near perfect showcase of it, Lelyetia is not so refined, and the pocket worlds obtained from fluix are a highly mechanized version of it. And yet, it is Fractallite magic, Fractallite magic I can see and learn from.\nOh, and to learn more about this I get to beat up this gravitationally-bound bird-lizard again? Yes please!",
