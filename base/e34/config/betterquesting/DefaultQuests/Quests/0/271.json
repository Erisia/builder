From what I have seen, their trategy, when it comes to incorporating new civilizations in their empire (as opposed to erasing a planet with little thought), primarily revolves around their military potential; with that said, I think natural resources may play a role too, at least in some cases. \nThe affinity of these resources to the chaotic, entropic effects I encountered on the upper sky of Terra is extremely interesting!\n...and powerful, very powerful!",
