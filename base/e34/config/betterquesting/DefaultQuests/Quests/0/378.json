You will soon unlock better ways of making them, so it is good to start working on reliable setups for all the mythic shell resources.\n\n§fFragments of a whole, now coming together. Recursive gems made into one, made into a unique substance, encopassing the whole of the powers and influence of the Shyre Empire, fragmented into the aspects of all societies it enslaved or ensnared.\nThe voices of injustice shall now speak, and shall now be used as weapons against their oppressor.\nThis gem carries the cries of the Universe, a universe that is tired of the abuse of those who gave up on their mission, and sought power instead.",
