Why do they share a society of undead nuclear scientists?\nI guess I shouldn\u0027t be surprised, the Meatball Man is powerful, so it would make sense that he would have control over some planets at least. But why work with the bees? And why collaborate with them to make nukes? \nOi is not a friendly place, but I think it will be a good idea to spend some time here. The meatball man has some interest in me, so I better try to gather intel on him.\nThe undead society of Oi is quite interesting too. Sunlight seems to be a general weakness to most of the undead, and their world is built around it. Roofs are readily available in an otherwise barren landscape, and they even use dark ineffable glass!",
