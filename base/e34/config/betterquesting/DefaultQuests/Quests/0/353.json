      "desc:8": "The paradox. My actions are free and foretold. I learned of the prophecies through the actions that were foretold in the same place. It is a snake that bites its own tail. By acting as a free agent, I became the subject of prophecies.\nIt is a paradox, that is undeniable, but for some reason, the longer I spend in this place, the less this bothers me. The higher I get into the layers of Vethea, the more aware of this I become. There is a paradox, and I may not be able of resolving it.\nI am finding myself capable of accepting this, and I am now more and more sure that those who are now lost in the eternal nighmare could not reconcile themselves with this. That is why I am becoming stronger, even in this place where they are stuck.\nI am free, and my freedom is to fulfill this prophecy!",
