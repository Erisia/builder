Mythic excavation, although limited, can break this limit in some way.\nWhile I am still not in need for this type of technology yet, knowing that it is possible makes me more prepared for the eventual future that awaits me.\nSpeaking of this future, an I ready? Can I really do it? All clues lead to the rulers of the Shyre Empire and Twilight Horde being Fractallites, possibly even stronger than the Meatball Man. After all, even with my new knoledge, and this newly found legacy, I am not sure I have what it takes, I have to make sure everything is in place!\nI do have to thank the Arbiter for laying out this plan for me. Everything was set right where I could and would remember of it, and just at the time when I could actually understand. A staging of this type is impressive, almost too impressive...",
