After examining some twilight horde creatures, like the corrupted beasts that fill the underground, it is clear that they share some sort common goal (which includes wanting to beat me up), but their behavior is primarily animalistic, and they have no evident organization.\nI\u0027m sure now that defeating one of the powerful among them made no difference in their resolution. I also have a suspicion that this Ancient Entity may have not been fully defeated...\n",
