Time to start preparing!\n\nTo get a steady supply of oxygen, you either need a full space suit, or a full set of armor enchanted with airtight seal.\n\nTo add oxygen to your armor set, pipe oxygen into a gas charge pad, and stand on it while wearing it.\n\n§fThis is interesting, I was able to generate matter that holds mythic powers on its own. It is not generated by mythic powers, it has mythic powers, all on its own.\nThis \u0027recursion\u0027 thing seems quite versatile. And yes, it does sit at a higher hierarchy. All magical sources I have encountered so far, all fields of space that allow for incredible wonders, are one, and that one is recursion. What is recursion, well, I know it keeps me alive, and that it lets beings more powerful than me exist in multiple places at once. Outside of that, though, I have no idea how it works, and how to control it.\nControl over this power is likely what powers the shyre empire\u0027s massive military might.\nWell, if they can use it, so can I!",
