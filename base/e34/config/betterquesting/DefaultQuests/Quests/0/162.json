Maybe!\n\n§fBeing able to bring in a steady supply of energy will be pivotal for my progress in understanding the powers I am against, and to provide a steady supply of materials, especially when automating magic processes takes up so much energy.\nInfusing fuel with magic can make it much more caloric! Sure, being hable to handle it requires some exotic materials, but it\u0027s going to be worth it, at least for now.\nI will likely have to start processing fissile fuels in the future, but I will cross that bridge when I get there!",
