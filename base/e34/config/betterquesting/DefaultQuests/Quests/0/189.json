      "desc:8": "While bee civilization seems to have some level of universal unity, and they really seem to be everywhere, they appear to have differing cultures based on the people they meet.\nThe bees of Orcus are strange, and quite creepy. Their territories are covered in blood, and they seem to be part of an actual cult of blood magic. \nFrom my past interactions with powerful blood masters, they always end up being some sort of mangled mass of flesh. I won\u0027t lie, I am not looking forward to facing more eldritch balls of flesh and blood.\nAnyhow, despite being a clearly violent blood cult, the bees I have met on Orcus were unusually nice, as if to them there was no contradiction between taking innocent animals from other worlds, kidnapping them, and sacrificing them, while at the same time helping me out, and even saying please and thank you.\nBee ethics sure are weird, I\u0027ll have to look more into this.",
