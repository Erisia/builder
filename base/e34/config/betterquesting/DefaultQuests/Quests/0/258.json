Their fate is truly sad. They were powerful, knowledgeable, and most importantly, curious. \nThe line between genuine inquisitiveness and greed is a fine one, and who knows wether or not the interests of the scholars of this land belonged to the former or the latter.\nWith regards to wanting to manipulate organic matter, there likely must have been a higher goal, a concrete objective, a mission.\nI wanted to be famous, to receive the Nobel prize. I know I was greedy with my pursuits, but the beauty of the unknown was still there to guide me, and what a beauty!",
