      "desc:8": "The alliance between the bees and the Realmshifters is incredible. Both people are extremely selfless, and this is quite moving. For them, the giving up of the self for the sake of what is good is a necessary sacrifice for a better future. They are weak by themselves, and yet, with selfless cooperation, they have been able to permeate the territories of the invaders of Terra.\nAfter having realized the ineffectiveness of the Polyphemus plan, of transforming their members into rage-filled, but comparatively weak, one-eyed berserkers, they started expanding their network of information.\nThe ability to travel anywhere is a useful one, and it has allowed this alliance to form a powerful network of spies, too weak to manipulate events at large, but also capable of remaining hidden from pretty much everyone else involved in this war.\nDue to their lack of power, they were awaiting for someone with eough military power to make use of their intel. After passing some sort of test, I guess I am that military power!",
