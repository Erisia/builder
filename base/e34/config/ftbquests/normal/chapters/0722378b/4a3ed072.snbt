		"The smeltery is built out of seared bricks placed in a cuboid shell, with no roof and no edges.",
		"The controller is where the interface is accessible, and acts as an item input (for automation).",
		"The tank is the smeltery's lava (or other hot fluid) input.",
		"Drains act as fluid output ports. Faucets and fluid pipes connect to drains.",
		"Tables and basins are placed under faucets to accept molten fluids. Basins turn them into blocks, tables can be used with a variety of casts (gold is better).",
		"Faucets output fluids when clicked, or with a redstone signal.",
		"Redstone clocks and timers are good for automating faucet extraction, if you don't want to use pipes."
