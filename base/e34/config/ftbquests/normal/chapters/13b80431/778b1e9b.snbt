		"While for many creatures it is impossible to perceive, nor travel through, higher dimensions, it is possible to explore them thanks to doors left all over the surface of Terra.",
		"The key behind these 'rifts' appears to be blood magic. Apparently, if enough life essence is sacrificed, higher dimensions can be 'connected to each other'.",
		"Some of the great secrets of blood arts are hidden in higher-dimensional fortresses that can only be reached through these doors."
