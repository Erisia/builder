		"Seems like, to become part of the empire, a civilization need to be considered 'powerful' by some sort of standard.",
		"Guess the testificated did not fulfill these requirements... ",
		"The fact that these almost omnipotent beings can choose what civilizations are worthy of existing is so sad...Kardashev was right I guess... Sad..."
