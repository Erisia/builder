		"Apparently, both of them achieved Kardashev type 5 status thanks to their leader's study of recursion.",
		"The hard step to achieve such a feat, accoding to the history of this land, is to obtain immortality.",
		"Then, apparently it's just a matter of time until recursion 'levels-up' to allow for more universe-impacting abilities."
		"At different points in time, the patriarchs of the horde and the empire discovered recursion, started expanding, and eventually ran into each other.",
