		"After kicking some major mythic ass, I think it's time for some wormholes of my own.",
		"The testificates on Diamerisma let me know that the world of Vibe has something I may be looking for.",
		"Every time a wormhole is opened, it is bound to a set of special locations scattered around the universe.",
		"Each of this locations contains a special mineral, like dimensional shards on terra, that bends space time in such a way to 'bind' the wormhole singularity.",
		"Most of these minerals are worthless, which is why my previous wormholes did not have any special resources, but Vibe contains something very interesting!",
		"Vibrating stone is a naturally occuring time crystal, a state of matter able to vibrate without using energy.",
