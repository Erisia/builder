		"While I'm at it, it's time to investigate the phenomenon of 'recursion', which apparently is the ability to 'perennially exist'.",
		"This is what allows me to come back every time after I 'die'.",
		"Many of the creatures I am encountering have this power, but, unlike me, they have control over it, while I am still bound to the will of whoever deciced to give me recursion.",
		"If I were able to learn this power, I may be able to gain the ability to split my being into multiple places as one, just like the ancient Entity...",
		"Now at least I undertand why theres so many withers; apparently there are only 6 but they are able to exist 'everywhere they are summoned' thanks to the power of recursion.",
		"The cause for why they are able to do so, is the Draconium that was used to originate the six original withers, or so testificate lore says.",
		"Draconium may be the key to mastering recursion, and free myself!"
