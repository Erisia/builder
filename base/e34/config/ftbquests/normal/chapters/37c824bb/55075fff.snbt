		"When doing magic, bad things may happen. In order to minimize negative effects to your world, the following order should be followed.",
		"1. Start with blood magic, until unlocking the Ritual of Eldritch will. This will prevent flux from building up.",
		"2. Start thaumcraft, until unlocking sanitizing soap. This will help out with temporary warp.",
		"3. Go through abyssalcraft, craft the abyssal wasteland warpe cleanser to get you going, and automate dreadlands warp cleansers. With this, permanent warp will stop being a problem.",
		"4. Now you are protected, feel free to right-click a Really Scary Vishroom!",
		"When it comes to other magic mods, feel free to progress though them in whichever way you prefer :)",
		"5. The omothol warp cleanser will completely eliminate the issue with warp!"
