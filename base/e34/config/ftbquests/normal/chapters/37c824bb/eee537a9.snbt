		"Eureka! I found the missing link! Not only gravity can be positive or negative, it can also be imaginary, producing rotations around non-existing objects.",
		"Metals like the one found on sedna, this cold, strange planet, produce motion that would be otherwise impossible at such distance from a star.",
		"This allows the planet to orbit a point located somewhere near Sol, yet this motion would happen anyway even if the star wasn't there!"
