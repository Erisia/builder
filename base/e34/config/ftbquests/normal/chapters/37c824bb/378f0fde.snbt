		"The power of wizardry is, well, seemingly unlimited.",
		"Just like knowledge, an infinite process that tries to approximate reality in increasingly accurate ways, with this type of magic, the sky is the limit.",
		"That said, the grand wizard that 'created' the land of Iceika may have flown too close to the sun, and paid the price for risking too much with their experiments.",
		"If this is what supreme ice power looks like, I am curious to see what 'awakened' versions of the other branches of wizardry look like.",
		"Definitely would be nice to learn how to change the climate of a planet.."
