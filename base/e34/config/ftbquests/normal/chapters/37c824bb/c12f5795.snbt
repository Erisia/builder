		"This 'recursion prison' that prevents me from dying, combined with some blood magic, can be very beneficial!",
		"Many of the creatures involved in this conflict, willingly or unwillingly, seem to be permeated by it. For most it's a small amount, much less than me.",
		"Recursion seems to be directly tied to the soul, and thanks to the magic knowledge I now have, I can start using it.",
		"It's nothing big, but I don't need essence to create living matter anymore!",
		"This means of organic replication is much more involved than using the 'standard' essence method developed back on earth (which is what I've been using until now).",
		"That said, on its upper end, it is much more effective!"
