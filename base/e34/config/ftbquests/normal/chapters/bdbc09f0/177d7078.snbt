	description: "A fission reactor is a cuboid of casings (edges & corners excluded) with at least one port for power output. For more info about the inside see attached quests.",
	text: [
		"Given a controller and casings around a cuboid, these reactors can be used for a variety of radioactive fuels.",
		"Depending on the fuels used, there are different heat requirements the reactor will need to fulfill to avoid meltdowns.",
		"The website https://leu-235.com/ is the recommended way of building these reactors.",
		"Design by Uchiwars also works well for power gen!",
