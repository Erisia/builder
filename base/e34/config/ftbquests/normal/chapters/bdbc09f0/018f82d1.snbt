		"This reactor uses the fusion between gases to produce A TON of RF.",
		"It is built with a controller in the middle. Out of each of the four 'arms' of the controller, at least one fusion connector should be placed.",
		"Starting from the ends of the connectors, electromagnets (preferrably of the transparent variety) are placed in a square toroid (leaving the middle empty).",
		"In order to properly function, the electromagnets require power (provided by RF) and cooling (using active fluid coolers).",
		"In a fusion reactor, central symmetry around the controller should be mantained for optimal results!"
